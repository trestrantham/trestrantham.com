<h2 class="hello">Hello.</h2>

My name is Tres Trantham. I'm a software developer, husband, father, and all
around technology geek.

I currently live in Holland, Michigan with my amazing wife Erin, our beautiful
daughter Penelope, and our dogs Oliver and Sophie.

I currently work in the banking and insurance realms as a Systems Architect
specializing in ETL Architecture and Development and Data Architecture. Check
out my [resume](/resume) if you would like to know more.

My spare time is spent crafting mobile and web applications, enjoying good
craft beer, and other musings of general nerdery. I'm a strong advocate for
usability and standards both on and off the web. I like simplicity in life and
design. And I've crashed in a Piper Navaho twin-engine aircraft.

I can also be found on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/trestrantham "Twitter") and
[Facebook](http://facebook.com/trestrantham "Facebook"). If you want to contact
me directly for any reason, please feel free to email
[me@trestrantham.com](mailto:me@trestrantham.com).
