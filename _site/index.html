    <h2 class="hello">Hello.</h2>


<p>My name is Tres Trantham. I'm a software developer, husband, father, and all
around technology geek.</p>

<p>I currently live in Holland, Michigan with my amazing wife Erin, our beautiful
daughter Penelope, and our dogs Oliver and Sophie.</p>

<p>I currently work in the banking and insurance realms as a Systems Architect
specializing in ETL Architecture and Development and Data Architecture. Check
out my <a href="/resume">resume</a> if you would like to know more.</p>

<p>My spare time is spent crafting mobile and web applications, enjoying good
craft beer, and other musings of general nerdery. I'm a strong advocate for
usability and standards both on and off the web. I like simplicity in life and
design. And I've crashed in a Piper Navaho twin-engine aircraft.</p>

<p>I can also be found on <a href="http://twitter.com/trestrantham" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> and
<a href="http://facebook.com/trestrantham" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>. If you want to contact
me directly for any reason, please feel free to email
